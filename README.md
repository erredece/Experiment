# Senior Project

Just my senior project, nothing else.

Visual stimuli consisting on the UNRAVEL task and memorizing images that are then presented either rotated or not while doing the UNRAVEL task. 
So it combines dual tasking and object recognition, the latter being the actual matter of study. 

Also a personal challenge to improve my coding skills, since I'm completely self taught and I really want to learn well.
